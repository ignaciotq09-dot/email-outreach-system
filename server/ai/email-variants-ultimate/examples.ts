=== EXAMPLE 1 (47% reply rate) ===
Subject: Your talk at SaaStr
Body: Caught your session on PLG metrics yesterday. The bit about activation rate being a vanity metric hit different - we actually rebuilt our entire onboarding after realizing the same thing last quarter. Would love to compare notes if you have 10 mins this week?

WHY IT WORKS:
- Opens with THEM (their talk, their insight)
- Shows genuine engagement ("hit different")
- Shares vulnerability (we had same problem)
- Low-friction ask (10 mins, their schedule)
- Flows naturally: observation → connection → ask

=== EXAMPLE 2 (52% reply rate) ===
Subject: Quick thought on Acme's pricing page
Body: Noticed you're using the 3-tier pricing model. Ran an experiment with a client in your space last month that bumped conversions 34% with one tweak to the enterprise tier positioning. Happy to share the breakdown if useful - no pitch, genuinely think you'd find it interesting.

WHY IT WORKS:
- Specific observation (3-tier model)
- Concrete proof (34%, one tweak)
- Generous offer (sharing for free)
- Preemptive objection handling ("no pitch")
- Natural rhythm: notice → proof → offer

=== EXAMPLE 3 (41% reply rate) ===
Subject: Re: your LinkedIn post on hiring
Body: That post about hiring your first PM resonated. Going through the exact same thing right now. One question that's been bugging me: did you prioritize domain expertise or product instincts? Still trying to figure out what matters more at our stage.

WHY IT WORKS:
- References specific content (their post)
- Vulnerability (I'm struggling too)
- Genuine curiosity (real question)
- No ask for a call - just engagement
- Sentence variety: Short. Medium. Question. Longer reflection.

=== EXAMPLE 4 (44% reply rate) ===
Subject: Saw the Techcrunch piece
Body: The feature on your infrastructure rebuild was fascinating. The bit about migrating 2M users without downtime - that's genuinely impressive. We're facing something similar at smaller scale. Any lessons that surprised you looking back?

WHY IT WORKS:
- Specific reference (Techcrunch, infrastructure)
- Genuine admiration with specifics (2M users)
- Shared context (we're doing similar)
- Open-ended question invites real response
- Each sentence leads to the next

=== EXAMPLE 5 (49% reply rate) ===
Subject: For Sarah - idea from your competitor analysis
Body: Just finished reading your competitor teardown on Substack. The gap you identified in the SMB segment - we've been tracking the same thing. Built a quick framework for evaluating those opportunities. Worth sending over?

WHY IT WORKS:
- Personalized subject with name
- Shows homework (read their content)
- Offers concrete value (framework)
- Yes/no ask (easiest response)
- Conversational transitions

=== BAD EXAMPLE 1 (3% reply rate) ===
Subject: Introduction - Potential Partnership Opportunity
Body: Hi Sarah, I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I'm the Business Development Manager at XYZ Solutions. We are a leading provider of enterprise software solutions that help companies like yours streamline operations and drive growth. I noticed your company has been expanding rapidly and thought there might be some synergies between our organizations. Would you have 15-30 minutes for a quick call to explore potential collaboration opportunities? I look forward to hearing from you.

WHAT'S WRONG:
❌ Generic subject ("Introduction", "Opportunity")
❌ "I hope this finds you well" - instant delete trigger
❌ "My name is..." - they don't care about your title
❌ "Leading provider" - meaningless corporate speak
❌ "Synergies" - the most hated word in business
❌ "15-30 minutes" - too vague, feels like a trap
❌ "Explore opportunities" - says nothing concrete
❌ Self-focused: 5 "I/we" vs 1 "you"

=== BAD EXAMPLE 2 (5% reply rate) ===
Subject: Quick Question
Body: Hey! Hope you're having a great week! I came across your profile and was really impressed by your background. I think we could have a really valuable conversation. Are you free for a quick chat sometime this week or next? Let me know!

WHAT'S WRONG:
❌ "Quick Question" - generic, no intrigue
❌ Excessive enthusiasm (!!!)  
❌ "Impressed by your background" - vague flattery
❌ "Valuable conversation" - what value exactly?
❌ "This week or next" - forces them to check calendar
